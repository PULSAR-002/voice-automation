# voice-automation
The repo contains a GUI version of voice assistant that will take the voice commands and will search it on internet on the specified browser.
The code can be easily modified to make the assistant more mature.
It uses the speech recognition to recognize the command and uses pyautogui library to perform the automated tasks and the GUI is built using tkinter.
Currently the assistant perform some specific tasks but it is easily modifiable and is currently not fully built by me.
Feel free to ask any questions, I'll be happy to help.
